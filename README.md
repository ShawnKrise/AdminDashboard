This is a React Admin Dashboard project. The purpose of this project was to learn Material UI, setup a Data Grid, and implement light and dark mode into my projects. I also utilized tools such as full calendar, formik, yup (for schema validation), and nivo charts. 

Note: This project was meant to enhance my front-end development skills and does not focus on backend development.  Instead I utilized data contained in a mockdata sheet. That is also the reason why some buttons such as the user profile icon can be pressed but have no functionality at this time.
